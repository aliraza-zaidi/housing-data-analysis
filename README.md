# Pakistan Housing Data Analysis 🏠

Welcome to this repository! This project provides an in-depth analysis of housing data in Pakistan, using Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. It also implements the analysis on Streamlit to provide an interactive mode for users. Additionaly, machine learning has been used for predicting prices.

## Data Description
The dataset for this project was fetched from Kaggle. The data itself was web-scrapped from Zameen.com and includes over 200,000 unique records setting the ground for an elaborate analysis. [Access it here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ebrahimhaquebhatti/pakistan-house-price-prediction)

## Main Steps in the Notebook and App
- Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled, and outliers were removed.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summary statistics were generated.
- Data Preprocessing: Features were encoded and standardized for modeling.
- Interactive Visualizations: The Streamlit app allows users to explore city-wise listings, property type distribution, and price comparisons interactively.
- Machine Learning: Regression models were applied for price prediction.

## Libraries Used
- Numpy & Pandas for Data Manipulation and Analysis 🔍
- Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly for Data Visualization 📊
- Sci-Kit Learn for Machine Learning 🤖
- Streamlit for an interactive Website 🌐
